26.	Write an R Program to create Reference Class and modify its Methods.
Reference class:

Defining reference class is similar to defining a S4 class. Instead of setClass() we use the setRefClass() function.
setRefClass("student")
Member variables of a class, if defined, need to be included in the class definition. Member variables of reference class are called fields (analogous to slots in S4 classes).

The function setRefClass() returns a generator function which is used to create objects of that class.

Another   Program
employeeRC <- setRefClass("employeeRC",
fields=list(name="character",age="numeric",
department="character",emp_id="numeric"),
methods=list(
show = function(){
  cat("name: ", name, "\n")
  cat("age: ", age,"\n")
  cat("department: ", department,"\n")
  cat("Id: ", emp_id,"\n")
}
))
emp4 <- employeeRC(name="jimmy",age=26,department="RnD"
,emp_id=00342)
show(emp4)
emp4$name<- "B.S.Rao"
emp4$emp_id=01617
emp4
out put
name:  jimmy 
age:  26 
department:  RnD 
Id:  342 
name:  B.S.Rao 
age:  26 
department:  RnD 
Id:  1617
