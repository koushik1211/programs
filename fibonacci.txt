7.	Write an R Program to Find the Fibonacci sequence Using Recursive Function
A function that calls itself is called a recursive function and this technique is known as recursion.
This special programming technique can be used to solve problems by breaking them into smaller and simpler sub-problems.
The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence is 0 followed by 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms.
This means to say the nth term is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th term.
The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
PROGRAM:
# Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term using recursive functions
recurse_fibonacci<-function(n){
if(n <= 1) {
return(n)
}else{
return(recurse_fibonacci(n-1)+recurse_fibonacci(n-2))
}
}
# take input from the user
nterms=as.integer(readline(prompt="How many terms?"))
# Check if the number of terms is valid
if(nterms<=0){
print("Please enter a positive integer")
}else{
print("Fibonacci sequence:")
for(i in 0:(nterms-1)) {
print(recurse_fibonacci(i))
}
}
Output:
How many terms? 9
[1]"Fibonacci sequence:"
[1] 0
[1]1
[1]1
[1]2
[1]3
[1]5
[1] 8
[1] 13
